# docxkit backlog

Defects and gaps found while using docxkit on real manuscripts, recorded
where the fix belongs. Append as you hit them; process in batches.

**Severity sets the order.** S1 silent wrong answer (reports success,
does the wrong thing) · S3 dead or permanently-red gate (people stop
reading it) · S2 wrong output no gate sees · S4 ergonomics. S3 outranks
S2 deliberately: a gate that cannot fail buys false confidence, and this
toolkit has been bitten twice that way.

**Done means:** fix + a test that fails without it + the per-paper
workaround deleted + entry moved to `## Fixed` with its commit. Keep
fixed entries; "did we ever fix that?" is a real question later.

## Open

### S4 `revision build`'s staleness refusal advertises a flag that does not exist
When `build/batch.docx` has changed since docxkit wrote it, `build`
refuses with:

    batch.docx has changed since docxkit built it - someone edited it in
    Word. Backed up to batch_user_edited1.docx; rebuilding would discard
    those edits. Fold them into the build source first, then re-run with
    force=True (CLI: --force).

`docxkit revision build --force` is `error: unrecognized arguments:
--force`; `build --help` lists only `--paper`, `--out`,
`--allow-math-resolve` and `--allow-pending-baseline`. The refusal is
right and the guard is worth having -- it is what stopped a spent batch
being silently overwritten on Parental_style 2026-08-12 -- but the way
out it names is fiction, and the two ways that DO work (`--out` to a
different path, or deleting the stale file) are not mentioned.

The trigger is not exotic: any post-build edit to `batch.docx` sets it
up. That paper hand-restores `customXml/` parts into the batch after
every build, because Compare drops them (entry above), so it trips the
guard on the very next build every time.

**Suggested shape.** Either add the flag, or name the real remedy:
"re-run with --out PATH, or delete build/batch.docx if the previous
batch is already promoted." The second is a one-line message change.

**Workaround in use** delete `build/batch.docx` and re-run; the backup
`batch_user_edited1.docx` already holds whatever was there.

### S2 `crossrefs --audit` never checks that an anchor leads its mentions
The audit proves a `<key>txt` bookmark EXISTS and RESOLVES. It does not
prove it sits on the FIRST in-text mention, which is the house
convention the rest of the scheme is built on — later mentions are
forward-only, and the caption's back-link is supposed to land the reader
at the first place the exhibit is discussed.

**Reproduced twice on Parental_style, from one cause (2026-08-12).** An
R8 batch inserted a disability paragraph that mentions Tables 4 and 5
ahead of the paragraphs that carried their markers. `Table5txt` sat on
the THIRD mention and `Table4txt` on the second, from 2026-08-11
onward, and **every audit in between reported `linked 12, dangling 0`**.
Both were found only because an unrelated edit had to move one of them;
a sweep then turned up the other.

**Why it matters.** The caption back-link silently jumps past the
discussion it belongs to. Nothing in the text layer shows it, `citations`
is clean, `lint` is clean. And the failure mode is systematic rather
than accidental: any batch that inserts a paragraph mentioning an
existing exhibit creates it.

**Suggested shape.** A `MISPLACED ANCHOR` line beside the existing
`MISPLACED MARKER` one: for each exhibit, compare the `<key>txt`
position against the first `w:anchor="<key>"` (both link forms, counted
together, as `wrap_link_in_bookmark(which="first")` already does) and
report when they differ. It is ~20 lines and it reuses machinery the
module already has — `wrap_link_in_bookmark(..., which="first")` exists
precisely because the convention has an answer.

**Workaround in use** a hand-rolled sweep in the Parental_style session,
now recorded in that paper's `log.md`; it should not have to live there.

### S2 `validate`'s reject-all check is blind to HYPERLINKS
`reject-all == baseline?` compares `paragraphs`, `glyphs` and
`footnotes`, prints the dict, and on success prints `VERDICT: PASS`.
Elsewhere the same tool phrases failure as "the batch is NOT fully
reviewable", so PASS reads as "rejecting everything restores the
baseline". For links it does not.

**Reproduced on Parental_style T4(3) (2026-08-12).** The batch deleted a
span holding two later-mention exhibit links. Rejecting restores the
sentences as PLAIN TEXT — hyperlink count comes back 227 against the
baseline's 229 — because Compare does not rebuild a link inside a
rejected deletion. `reject-all` reported OK, `citations` reported ALL
CHECKS PASSED (they were later mentions, so nothing dangled), and the
author would have been two links short with nothing anywhere saying so.

**Arguably S1** — it reports success for a property it does not test,
and the surrounding wording invites the stronger reading. Filed S2
because the dict does name what was compared; the owner may want to
promote it.

**Suggested shape.** Add `links` to the comparison dict, counting
(anchor, label) pairs on the rejected view against the baseline. The
`_link_labels` guard written for the S1 emptying case already computes
exactly that pair set.

**Workaround in use** "if a batch that deletes linked text is rejected,
re-run `relink_mentions.py`", recorded in the paper's log — a rule
nobody will remember at the moment it matters.

### S4 `footnotes --check` calls the malformed majority "house"
The check reports the reference-mark size shared by most notes as the
house value and flags the minority. On Parental_style (2026-08-12) that
was exactly backwards: five footnote paragraphs carried no `w:pStyle`
at all, fell through `Normal` to `docDefaults` 12pt, and got their 10pt
body text from an explicit `sz 20` on every run; the two the check
FLAGGED were the two carrying `pStyle="FootnoteText"` — the well-formed
ones. Acting on the report as written would have stripped the correct
style off the correct notes.

The message already says the right thing — "check the paragraph's
`w:pStyle` before writing anything onto the mark" — so the tool
anticipates the trap and then hands over a report that points the other
way.

**Suggested shape.** Split the marks by HOW they resolve, not by how
many share a value: mark-size-from-`FootnoteText`, mark-size-from-
`docDefaults`, mark-size-stated-on-the-run. Name the styled group as the
well-formed one regardless of count, and say which paragraphs lack a
`pStyle` — that is the actionable fact and it is one attribute lookup.

**Workaround in use** `Parental_style/revision/scripts/applied/footnote_style.py`,
which reasons the direction out from `styles.xml` by hand and refuses to
run if any footnote has a text run without an explicit size.

### S2 `revision build` silently DROPS every `customXml/` part
Word's Compare rebuild discards `customXml/item1.xml`,
`customXml/itemProps1.xml` and `customXml/_rels/item1.xml.rels`, strips
the `/customXml/itemProps1.xml` Override out of `[Content_Types].xml`,
and removes the customXml Relationship from
`word/_rels/document.xml.rels`. `build` prints `WARNING: Compare part
dropped: customXml/item1.xml` — but it prints the same warning for
`docProps/app.xml`, `core.xml` and `custom.xml`, which Word regenerates
on save and which nobody needs to care about. The signal is buried in
noise that is genuinely ignorable.

**Why it matters.** `promote` copies the batch over `working.docx`, so
the parts are gone from the live manuscript. Nothing downstream
notices: `lint` is clean, `validate` PASSes, Word opens the file
happily. Reproduced on Parental_style 2026-08-12, where the author's
Word had just added an empty `b:Sources` bibliography store — a
Compare batch would have deleted it, and the next `ingest` would have
reported three parts removed with no explanation of who removed them.

**Suggested shape.** Two changes, either of which would have caught it.
(1) `build` should CARRY dropped parts across rather than warn, or at
minimum separate "regenerated by Word, ignore" (`docProps/*`) from
"lost, and only you can put it back" (everything else). (2) `validate`
should compare the part LIST against the baseline and fail on a part
present in prev and absent from the batch — the reject-all check
already proves the text round-trips; nothing proves the package does.

Restoring by hand needs three coordinated edits (the parts, the
`[Content_Types].xml` Override, a Relationship on a free `rId`), which
is exactly the sort of thing that belongs in the toolkit rather than in
a paper's script directory.

**Workaround in use** `Parental_style/revision/log.md` now carries a
pre-promote check, and the batch of 2026-08-12 restored the three parts
inline before promoting.

### S1 `allow_hyperlink=True` lets the LINK SWALLOW the replacement
The counterpart of the refusal added in `031e96d`, and the same silent
wrong answer wearing the opposite mask. The guard now refuses a span
that crosses a link; the opt-in that overrides it does not merely permit
the edit, it takes the normal path — write the whole replacement into
the run holding the START of the match, empty the rest — and when that
first run is the link's label the link ends up owning every word.

Reproduced on the Parental_style Table 4 caption (2026-08-12). The
caption opens with a `Table4txt` back-link labelled `Table 4`; anchoring
on the full caption and passing `allow_hyperlink=True` turned the label
into `Table 4: The likelihood of using non-violent and coercive
discipline`, so two thirds of the caption rendered blue and underlined.

**Why S1.** Every gate passed: `lint` clean, `citations` ALL CHECKS
PASSED including "0 with no label", `crossrefs` 12/12, all 1,680 table
values. The anchor still resolves and the words still read correctly, so
nothing that walks anchors or text can see it. The only signal was
`compare`'s HYPERLINK layer, explicitly "REVIEW; not gated" —
`[built-only] 'Table 4'` against a `[user-only]` label carrying the whole
caption. That is the exact pair of properties that made the emptying
case S1.

**Suggested shape.** `allow_hyperlink` currently answers one question
("may this match cross a link?") and is silently answering a second
("may the label absorb text?"). Split them: keep the opt-in for a span
that crosses a link, but make the write refuse to GROW a label — a
replacement whose first run is a link label should either distribute
across the boundary or raise. A caller who genuinely wants to retitle a
link should say so with a distinct argument.

**The check.** Extend `_xml.dead_links`'s neighbourhood — it currently
reports a label that lost its text; the mirror is a label that gained
text it never had. A cheaper gate that would have caught this specific
case: no link label may contain a sentence-ending `:` or `.` followed by
more words, which is what a swallowed caption looks like. Whatever the
rule, it belongs in the citation audit, not in `lint`.

**Workaround in use.** Locate on the long signature, replace only a
short span lying entirely on one side of the link — as
`Parental_style/revision/scripts/applied/v8_mechanical.py` does for both
the Table 4 caption and the M5(b) sentence.

## Fixed

### S4 two definitions of "what this paragraph says" — `35fd07b`
**Decision (2026-08-11, the author's): name both.** `visible_text` is
the reader's — `w:t` and `m:t` — and what `para_slice`, `crossrefs`,
`citations` and compare locate with. `editable_text` is what a run walk
can address, now a name in `_xml` rather than a join inlined in
`replace_in_para`. Over 399 manuscripts they differ on 256, and the
maths is the only thing they differ over.

Widening the editor was rejected on the grounds recorded when the entry
was opened: it would find phrases it could not write. Instead the
refusal explains itself — when the anchor is in the reader's text and
not in the run walk, `replace_in_para` names the equation.

`edit.py` had held both readings all along: `_locate` was fixed for
this in the DSI §6.3 round, with a comment that "two definitions of
visible in one call path is one too many", and `replace_in_para` beside
it still joined the runs alone.

### S2 `PARA_RE` read a self-closing `<w:p/>` as an open tag — `6acc545`
Found by the refactor that consolidated the duplicated element patterns
into `_xml`, and it was in the shared definition itself: `[^>]*`
swallows the slash of an EMPTY paragraph, so the walk ran on to the next
paragraph's close and the span a caller got back began at the blank line
BEFORE the one it asked for. Splicing that span deletes the author's
blank line; `probe` reported "(no table follows)" for a table sitting
right under its caption.

**816 paragraph spans in 233 of 399 manuscripts started too early.** No
oracle saw it — the merged block's TEXT is the text that was asked for,
so only the offsets moved. `_compare_read.P_RE` had the guard by
accident of spelling and was the only paragraph walk in the package that
was right.

Fixed with the `(?<!/)>` ghost guard already used for hyperlinks. An
empty paragraph is invisible to the walk rather than returned as its
own, which keeps every report's `¶N` numbering where it was.

### S4 `footnotes.sizes` skips the reference mark untested — `cf6c0f2`
The entry refused to widen anything without evidence and named the
evidence it wanted. Measured over 331 manuscripts with footnotes: **26
state a size on the mark, and in 22 of them exactly ONE mark RESOLVES
differently from the rest** — 10pt against 11pt in IGM, TCC and Parental
Style, several submitted. So "no document on this machine sizes it" was
false.

LI's is the shape that matters: every mark run is byte-identical, one
note's PARAGRAPH lost its `FootnoteText` style, and that mark alone
falls to the document default and is drawn a point larger — while its
body text states 20 like everyone else, so the existing check reports
the note as conforming.

The marks are now compared to EACH OTHER, which keeps the quiet the
exclusion was protecting: 291 of 331 documents say nothing, and the 40
that speak are versions of three papers with one finding apiece. A mark
whose size does not resolve is not judged, the way the body half already
declines. `--check` says which of the two it met, because they need
different repairs.

### S4 `citations.repair_plan` proposed deleting a live entry as debris — `fda1788`
The evidence it used could not work for that name: the bookmark was
minted by an older strip-only stem (accents dropped, not folded) while
"Bühler-Niederberger (2022)" keys as `bühlerniederberger_2022`, because
`\w` keeps the umlaut. The two spellings never meet, so a live work
reads as uncited however carefully it is cited.

The question now goes to the reference LIST, as the entry demanded —
`_own_bookmark` knows both stems and reads the hoisted gap — and a
finding on a live entry is re-classified as the lost citation LINK it
actually is. Both bookmark placements tested: reading the entry
paragraph alone brings the false debris call straight back.

### S4 a bookmark deletion cannot ship through Word Compare — `114b464`
`restored_bookmarks(baseline, clean, built)` names them and `build` says
so before the handback, with the remedy the three rounds arrived at.
Three sides, because the BASELINE is what makes the answer mean
something: "in the build, not in the clean edit" also describes a name
Word MINTED during the compare, and reporting that as the author's
deletion sends them looking for an edit they never made.

### S4 `build/batch.docx` is reserved but not guarded — `114b464`
It refuses at the call now, and names `build/clean.docx` as the place to
put a hand-built edit. The old failure came from the far end — the
provenance stamp reading the edit as a Word session that never happened.

### S4 `wrap_link_in_bookmark` has no "first mention" mode — `3d42a31`
`which="first"`. The rewrite also fixed a counting bug the entry did not
know about: the two link FORMS were counted separately, so a work linked
once as a field and once as an element passed the element branch as
unique — and Word rewrites a field into an element on every author save,
so a manuscript mid-round holds one of each. The bookmark would have
landed wherever form churn left it.

**Workarounds to retire** `repair_round3_links.py` and `_wrap_first` in
`repair_round5.py`; both stay as records of their rounds, but neither
technique is forced on the next paper.

### S2 `revision build` under-reports what Compare baked in untracked — `af355b7`
### S2 a moved footnote ANCHOR makes Compare emit the footnote as an unmatched insert — `af355b7`
### S4 `revision validate` says reject-all MISMATCH but not WHAT failed — `af355b7`
Three entries, one commit, because they are the same complaint from
different ends: the protocol knew a batch was unreviewable and would not
say what.

`untracked(parts, baseline)` returns the paragraphs where reject-all does
not reproduce the baseline — the computation gate 5 already performed and
threw away. `build` says it BEFORE the handback, `validate` after.
`moved_footnotes` names the second cause by itself: insertions, no
deletions, and text already at that id in the baseline (the last clause
is what keeps a genuinely NEW note off the list).

The MathResolved refusal no longer advises "author this batch by hand
instead", which named no supported call. It says what is true: the batch
has no reviewable redline.

**Two of the four footnote tests reached none of this** —
`moved_footnotes` only runs when gate 5 FAILS, and those fixtures
rejected cleanly, so both mutations lived. They test the function
directly now.

### S2 `citations.link_rest` is blind to entry bookmarks Word has HOISTED — `a2f28a2`
`link_all` already reads the body-level gap before each entry, for this
exact reason and with this exact comment. `_entry_names_from_document`
did not, so the two halves of one convention disagreed about where a
marker lives. The surname-AND-year test in `_own_bookmark` is what makes
the wider search safe.

Measured read-only on the three live manuscripts:

                          skipped        would link
    Parental_style        0 -> 0          0 -> 0
    Life_Expectancy       5 -> 3          3 -> 5
    Loneliness Index     44 -> 7          1 -> 38

**Thirty-seven later mentions on LI** the pass had been declining. What
still skips are entries whose bookmark is genuinely absent or filed
under a name the surname test cannot match ("Commission 2024", "UN
2019b") — a different question.

**Not done:** the entry's second suggestion, that `citations` report "N
later mentions unlinked". The audit deliberately treats a later mention
as fine — the house convention links first mentions only — so that
number would contradict the check beside it. `link_rest`'s own report is
where the count belongs, and it is there.

**Workaround to retire** `_link_citations` in `relink_mentions.py`; the
script stays as the record of the round.

### S2 `compare`'s FIELD layer reports targets that are present as lost — `122a180`
The entry guessed "pairs paragraphs by text"; the real mechanism is that
inside a replace run the pairing is POSITIONAL, so the inserted Heading2
made the block 4 against 5 and shifted every pair after it by one.

Three rules, measured over 748 real comparisons (every version pair on
this machine, and every document against itself):

    per pair                1,463 named lost, 594 still present  59.4%
    per BLOCK               1,764 named lost, 246 still present  86.1%
    + surviving, per part   1,540 named lost,  27 still present  98.2%
    + surviving, package    1,521 named lost,   8 still present  99.5%

It also names MORE true losses (869 → 1,513): a pair whose prose came
through glyph-identical never reached the old test at all. TEXT,
STRUCTURE and GLYPH are byte-identical across all 748.

The header no longer asserts a cause and a direction it cannot know.

### S1 `replace_in_para` empties a hyperlink's LABEL when the match spans it — `031e96d`
Both halves, because the entry's own "why it is S1" was that nothing
catches it.

**The refusal.** A run is somebody's label if it is hyperlink-STYLED or
if it sits inside a `<w:hyperlink>` element — the style is what a
field-form result run carries, the element is what an unstyled
element-form label has. Both forms fail the same way and both were
reproduced first. Same `allow_hyperlink` opt-in as the existing guard.

**The check.** `_xml.dead_links`, reported by the citation audit as
EMPTY LINK. It went there rather than into `lint` because the file is
not malformed — Word opens it happily — and `write_docx` must not start
refusing documents over it.

**It found live damage in submitted work.** 103 hits over 397
manuscripts, ~10 distinct defects repeated across archived versions:
LE ¶25's `Elder2013` is an empty field standing where the citation was
("confirmed by [ ]Ludwig and Zimper (2013)"), LE ¶40's `Table3` the same,
five of LI's footnote citations read as plain "(Catalano 2003)" followed
by a train of empty fields, and IGM ¶716's `Table4_text`. **Each of those
papers needs a repair round of its own** — recorded here because the
toolkit is what found them.

A link inside a tracked DELETION is excluded: it is not in the final
document. Four sit in LE le12, and reporting them would put every
redline on the list.

**Workaround to retire** `_link_labels` in `readability_pass.py` is no
longer needed as a guard — the refusal is upstream of it now — but the
script stays as the record of the round.

### S2 a possessive citation is left unlinked and reported UNLINKED — `a66259c`
The entry blamed the author-chain grammar and the grammar was innocent:
`find_citations` returns `"Doepke and Zilibotti's (2017)"` whole. Two
other things were wrong, one per layer, and both are wider than the
entry.

**The key carried the possessive.** The apostrophe is a NAME character
(D'Souza), so `key_for` stripped the punctuation without removing the
*s*: `beckers_1981`, which no entry answers to. A SINGLE-author
possessive could not be linked at all — the reported case worked only by
luck, its lead author being someone else. On a chain the suffix falls
outside `_NAME` and `"Doepke et al.'s (2019)"` was invisible to the
finder.

**The audit paired a mention to the links by its WORDING.** Resolving it
to its entry instead, over 397 real manuscripts: 36 changed, **41
findings removed, 0 added**. Thirty-eight are one shape nobody had
named — a label stopping a character short, `"Davletov et al. (2016"`,
because the closing parenthesis sits in a run outside the hyperlink.

The measurement also caught the fix overreaching: LE le12's finding is
real (the author retyped the sentence and dropped its link, while the
tracked DELETION beside it still carried the old one), so the evidence
must be visible in the FINAL document.

**Workaround** `repair_round5.py` stays as the record of a spent round;
the technique is no longer forced on the next paper.

### S3 `compare`'s FORMAT layer cannot see size or colour — `6920980`
FORMAT now carries `size` and `colour`, **resolved** through the new
`styles.Cascade` — direct run properties, then the character style
chain, then the paragraph style chain, then docDefaults — rather than
read off the run. The resolution is the whole design, not a refinement:
Word deletes a direct property equal to the inherited one, so comparing
what a run STATES reports a change on every author round-trip, which is
how a widened gate becomes a gate nobody reads.

Both directions are tested, and the pair that opened the entry now
enumerates correctly:

    footnote 5   size 24 -> colour 000000, size 20     the real fix
    footnote 6   size 20 -> colour 000000, size 20     colour only, and
                                                       right: it resolved
                                                       to 20 either way
    footnote 7   size 24 -> colour 000000, size 20     the real fix

Hyperlink runs still contribute no EMPHASIS — their underline is
structural — but their colour IS compared, resolved through the
Hyperlink style so the ordinary case is equal on both sides. That is
what makes footnote 5's eleven links in Word's default blue visible
where the house navy was meant.

**Measured before shipping, over three corpora: 136 documents compared
against THEMSELVES, 0 noisy.** The version-pair findings are all real —
a body size changed between two generations of one paper, citation links
gaining or losing a colour. With no `styles.xml` in the package the
layer compares emphasis only and says so in its docstring: silence
beats a guess, because a stated-value comparison there would report the
redundant-declaration case as a change.

**Second copy retired.** `footnotes.sizes` had grown its own resolver an
hour earlier; it now uses `Cascade`, which is also strictly wider — it
had known paragraph styles only, and a run's own character style carries
a size just as well.

### S3 `revisions.accept`/`reject` ignore every PROPERTY revision — `760b45b`
Both views passed a `*PrChange` straight through, so an XML-accepted
file still counted as a proposal and a rejected one kept the formatting
it was supposed to undo. What that cost: **gate 5, `reject-all ==
baseline`, could not fail on a formatting-only batch** — it compares
paragraph text and the glyph stream, and reject changed no formatting
anyway, so the gate that exists to prove the author's veto is real
passed vacuously on the Parental_style footnote round.

Accept drops the record; reject puts the snapshot back. Three things a
wholesale restore would have lost, each now carried across by hand and
named in the code: `pPrChange/pPr` is CT_PPrBase and cannot hold the
paragraph MARK's `w:rPr` — where that kind of revision's own flag lives;
`sectPrChange/sectPr` is CT_SectPrBase and drops every header and footer
reference, which CT_SectPr puts FIRST; a `w:trPr` carries the row's own
insert flag beside the formatting record. Property changes are applied
LAST for the same reason.

`test_revision_state.py` had a guard that `_has_revisions` and
`revision.state` agree on all seven kinds. It now has the third face of
it — anything `state` counts is something the simulator can APPLY —
which fails 8 ways without this fix.

### S3 a batch of 25 revisions is reported as "0 revisions" — `760b45b`
`revision build` printed `revisions: 0` and gate 3 `opened, 0 revision
groups` for a batch carrying 25 `w:rPrChange` in `word/footnotes.xml`,
because Word's `Document.Revisions` walks the MAIN STORY only. It reads
as "Compare could not represent this batch" — the documented
`MathResolved` failure — and half an hour went into proving the batch
was sound. `package_counts` gained a `revisions` key over every kind and
every text-bearing part, `BuildReport.revisions` is read off the built
PACKAGE with Word's count kept beside it as `body_revisions`, and both
messages now say "in the body" where that is what they mean.

### S2 `footnotes.sizes` flags a note whose STYLE supplies the size — `760b45b`
`sizes` takes `styles_xml` and resolves a run that states nothing
through its paragraph's `pStyle` chain (`basedOn` followed, cycles
survived), then the document default. On the manuscript that produced
the check:

    blind to styles   3 disagreeing — footnotes 5, 6 and 7
    with the styles   2 disagreeing — "resolves to 12pt through the
                                       document default"

Footnote 6 carries `pStyle FootnoteText`, that style says `w:sz 20`, and
it had always rendered at 10pt: a false positive on the first real paper
the check was pointed at, which the 134-document sweep could not surface
because no other paper mixes the two. Word agreed independently — its
Compare DROPPED the redundant explicit size written onto that run and
kept only the colour, the same "Word deletes a declaration equal to the
inherited value" behaviour `table_spacing` already records.

Without the part the disagreement is still reported: the answer
genuinely is not in `footnotes.xml`, and silence would be a claim this
cannot support.

### S4 `revision status` printed every stale part on one line — `760b45b`
Sixteen names, twelve of them `word/fonts/font*.odttf` from one tick of
Word's embed-fonts box. Folded by directory —
`word/fonts/ (12 parts)` — and capped at four entries with "and N more".
The test written for the cap caught a bug in the fold: a part at the
package ROOT has no directory, and folding it under `""` dropped
`[Content_Types].xml` off the line entirely.

### S2 no check that footnotes share one size — `a07f8fd`
`footnotes.sizes(xml) -> SizeReport`, plus `docxkit footnotes PAPER.docx
[--check]`. It went to `footnotes` rather than `hygiene` as the entry
suggested, because `footnotes.fonts` was already asking the neighbouring
question and `set_font` is already the repair — a footnote check in
`hygiene` would have split the seam.

Reported as a DISAGREEMENT, not as a wrong value, which is what the
entry's symptom demands: the offender states nothing, so no search for a
wrong number can find it. The house size is what most footnotes state,
so a document whose footnotes all inherit — every size in styles.xml,
perfectly ordinary — reports nothing. Ids 0 and -1 are skipped by
`find_all` already. Runs with no visible text are not asked: the
`w:footnoteRef` run is formatted by the FootnoteReference style and
states no size on purpose, and counting it would put every conforming
document on the list.

**Swept over real manuscripts, which is the only way to know a check
like this does not cry wolf: 134 clean, 0 flagged** across Life
Expectancy, DSI and FLOPsExport.

**And it found a LIVE one the workaround missed.** Parental_style
`revision/working.docx` still has three footnotes (5, 6, 7) whose text
runs carry no `w:sz`. *(Corrected the same day: TWO of them — 5 and 7 —
actually rendered wrong. Footnote 6 takes 10pt from `pStyle
FootnoteText`, which is the style-resolution entry above.)* `fix_display_math.py` skipped them because it
tested `'<w:sz w:val=' in blob` and the PARAGRAPH MARK's `w:rPr` carries
one — the mark's own formatting, not the runs'. Worth a batch on that
paper: `footnotes.set_font(xml, size=10)`.

### S2 no display-mode support, and Word's auto-promotion is unreliable — `eee8274`
`equations.display(para, jc="center")` wraps the paragraph's maths in an
`m:oMathPara`, idempotently; `equations.inline_display(xml)` is the audit
half and `docxkit math` now prints "N display equation(s), M still in
INLINE mode" with the equation named, gated by `--check`.

Both halves of the gotcha were put through Word rather than trusted, by
round-tripping a built document through Flat OPC — the package Word
hands back is what Word would have saved:

| written | after Word |
|---|---|
| bare `m:oMath` | **promoted** — and with no `oMathParaPr`, so not centred either |
| `display()` | kept, centring and all |
| `display(absorb=True)` | kept |
| `display()` + a trailing run | **demoted back to inline** |

So the auto-promotion is real, unreliable *and* not enough (it does not
centre), and the trailing-run demotion reproduces exactly. `display`
therefore drops empty runs, REFUSES a run carrying text — naming it —
and offers `absorb=True` to move it inside the maths instead, which is
how a numbered appendix equation is built. Text BEFORE the equation is
refused even under `absorb`: moving it after the maths is a reordering
no text diff would show.

### S2 `latex_to_omml` output needs a normalization pass — `ab891bd`
New `equations._normalize`, run on every conversion. Each before/after
was RENDERED through Word, which is the only gate that sees any of this.

* **the accent** — `\overline{v}` → `m:chr` U+2015 HORIZONTAL BAR, and
  the render confirmed it: the v is struck through. Now U+0305
  COMBINING OVERLINE, which draws as Word's own `m:bar` does. An
  `m:groupChr`'s character is left alone — a bar is legitimate there.
* **the sign** — worse than reported, and not confined to
  `\frac{(-)}{(-)}`: latex2mathml reads the minus in **`(-1)`** as the
  fence's SEPARATOR, so it arrives as an empty `m:e` plus `1` with the
  sign in `m:sepChr`, and the page reads `(   −1)`. Same for `[-1]`,
  `|-1|`, `\{-1\}`, `(-)`. Now rejoined into one `m:e` with the sign
  inline; delimiters survive. **The tell is the empty element, not the
  separator**: `(x,y)` and `(a-b)` arrive in the same shape with both
  elements filled, where the separator is real and drawn — firing on
  the separator alone would flatten them.
* **the NBSP** — did not reproduce as written. On latex2mathml 3.81.0
  `\quad` emits nothing at all (the spacing is dropped), and `\{x\}`
  builds a proper `m:d`, not a literal brace. The NBSP that does reach
  the math comes from `\text{ if }` and `~`, where the space is CONTENT
  and the converter is right to keep it. So the fix went where the harm
  was: `document_symbols` no longer harvests the NBSP or the invisible
  operators into the paper's vocabulary. `to_latex` still knows them —
  it has to render them — but a space is not evidence of math, which is
  what turned one finding into nineteen. Braces left alone: a bare
  brace in a paper's math is a fair thing to flag.

**Workarounds:** `theory_merge.py` and `fix_a3_signs.py` stay in
`scripts/applied/` — spent scripts are records of a round, not code to
delete — but neither technique is forced on the next paper.
**Bonus:** `word.export_pdf` resolves its destination. Handed a relative
path it wrote the render into WORD's working directory and returned a
path with no file at it. Found by using it for the render above.

### S3 gate 6 counts a drawing as a text difference — `712e2fd`
Measured before encoding, as the entry demanded — a synthetic package
whose only content was a picture and two letters, so the character at
the drawing's offset could not be a neighbour's. Word's `Range.Text`:

| form | what Word returns |
|---|---|
| `w:drawing` + `wp:inline` | one `/` (U+002F, ord 47) |
| `w:drawing` + `wp:anchor` (floating) | **nothing** — not in the stream |
| `w:pict`, `w:object` (legacy inline) | U+0001, already stripped by `_norm` |
| a text box's prose | absent — a different STORY |

So `_glyph` emits `/` for an inline drawing only, and grew a
`main_story=True` mode that prunes `w:txbxContent` for the gate that
compares against Word (the XML-to-XML gate still wants that prose). The
text-box half was NOT in the original report — the same probe found it,
and it would have kept gate 6 permanently red on any paper with a text
box. Still not a `_FOLD` entry: folding `/` away would blind the gate to
every "and/or" and every URL.
**Bonus:** gate 5 (reject-all == baseline) now notices a figure a batch
dropped. Neither paragraph text nor the old glyph stream changed when a
drawing vanished.
**Verified on the paper that reported it:** Parental_style
`working.docx`, zero revisions — gate 6 `False` before, `True` after.

### S3 `revision status` says TRUTH/TRUTH when prev and working differ — `a897948`
New `revision.drift(working, prev)` compares MEANING part by part
(`package.part_fingerprint`, save-noise excluded) and returns the parts
that differ; `status` asks it only of a settled file — while a proposal
is pending the two are *supposed* to differ — and exits **4** with the
part named and the remedy printed. Exit 0 now means both settled AND
built on a current baseline, which is what a script checking it was
already assuming. Verified failing without the fix: the stale case
exited 0.
**Bonus:** `ruff` and `mypy` were both red at HEAD on
`tests/test_pathological.py` (a long line and an untyped wrapper from
`1c09490`). Fixed here — two of the four gates being red is the same
S3 class as the entry above.

### S1 `crossrefs.unlink`/`link` blind to field-form hyperlinks — `1c09490`
`unlink` removed the bookmarks, left every HYPERLINK field standing and
returned "24 removed". Now raises `ConversionGap` naming the anchors and
saying what to do instead; `link` reports them as `field_form` rather
than stacking a second scheme on the caption. New public helper
`crossrefs.field_targets(xml)`.
**Workaround to retire:** the symmetric identifier swap in
`Parental_style/revision/scripts/applied/swap_tables_1_2.py` stays as a
record of the round, but the technique is no longer forced — a future
paper gets a clear refusal instead of a wrong answer.
**Bonus:** the pathological harness now treats a deliberate refusal as a
SAFE mutator outcome (nothing written ⇒ parseable, text-preserving and
idempotent all hold). Only an uncontrolled exception is a failure.

### S3 `_norm` did not fold U+2032 `′` against U+0027 `'` — `00db587`
Gate 6 (XML accept == Word accept) could not pass on a paper that writes
derivatives; proved on a ZERO-revision file. Folded, with a test verified
to fail without the fix. What remains of that entry is the drawing
placeholder, still open above.

### S3 cover letter printed "ALL CHECKS PASSED: /" — repkit, `c3391ab`
Recorded here because it is the same class: `refresh` re-writes the
letter without re-running the suite, so it passes no check count, and the
template interpolated it anyway. Fixed with a fallback and a regression
test verified to fail against the old template. (Lives in repkit; listed
once here as the worked example of the format.)
