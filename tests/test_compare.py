"""Characterization tests for the ported compare module.

compare.py is the authoritative gate every paper round relies on, and it
came over from tools/ verbatim — well-exercised but never unit-tested.
These pin its CURRENT behavior on synthetic fixtures so a future change
(or the eventual de-porting) has something to diff against. They assert
what it does, not what it should do.
